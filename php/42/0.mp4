<P><FONT FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Today, we are constantly being told,
the United States faces a health care crisis. Medical costs are too high,
and health insurance is out of reach of the poor. The cause of this crisis
is never made very clear, but the cure is obvious to nearly everybody:
government must step in to solve the problem.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Eighty years ago, Americans were
also told that their nation was facing a health care crisis. Then, however,
the complaint was that medical costs were too <I>low, </I>and that health
insurance was too <I>accessible. </I>But in that era, too, government stepped
forward to solve the problem. And boy, did it solve it!</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times,Times New Roman">In the late 19th and early 20th centuries,
one of the primary sources of health care and health insurance for the
working poor in Britain, Australia, and the United States was the fraternal
society. Fraternal societies (called "friendly societies" in Britain and
Australia) were voluntary mutual-aid associations. Their descendants survive
among us today in the form of the Shriners, Elks, Masons, and similar organizations,
but these no longer play the central role in American life they formerly
did. As recently as 1920, over one-quarter of all adult Americans were
members of fraternal societies. (The figure was still higher in Britain
and Australia.) Fraternal societies were particularly popular among blacks
and immigrants. (Indeed, Teddy Roosevelt's famous attack on "hyphenated
Americans" was motivated in part by hostility to the immigrants' fraternal
societies; he and other Progressives sought to "Americanize" immigrants
by making them dependent for support on the democratic state, rather than
on their own independent ethnic communities.)</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times,Times New Roman">The principle behind the fraternal
societies was simple. A group of working-class people would form an association
(or join a local branch, or "lodge," of an existing association) and pay
monthly fees into the association's treasury; individual members would
then be able to draw on the pooled resources in time of need. The fraternal
societies thus operated as a form of self-help insurance company.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Turn-of-the-century America offered
a dizzying array of fraternal societies to choose from. Some catered to
a particular ethnic or religious group; others did not. Many offered entertainment
and social life to their members, or engaged in community service. Some
"fraternal" societies were run entirely by and for women. The kinds of
services from which members could choose often varied as well, though the
most commonly offered were life insurance, disability insurance, and "lodge
practice."</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times,Times New Roman">"Lodge practice" refers to an arrangement,
reminiscent of today's HMOs, whereby a particular society or lodge would
contract with a doctor to provide medical care to its members. The doctor
received a regular salary on a retainer basis, rather than charging per
item; members would pay a yearly fee and then call on the doctor's services
as needed. If medical services were found unsatisfactory, the doctor would
be penalized, and the contract might not be renewed. Lodge members reportedly
enjoyed the degree of customer control this system afforded them. And the
tendency to overuse the physician's services was kept in check by the fraternal
society's own "self-policing"; lodge members who wanted to avoid future
increases in premiums were motivated to make sure that their fellow members
were not abusing the system.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Most remarkable was the low cost
at which these medical services were provided. At the turn of the century,
the average cost of "lodge practice" to an individual member was between
<I>one and two dollars a year.</I> A day's wage would pay for a year's
worth of medical care. By contrast, the average cost of medical service
on the regular market was between one and two dollars <I>per visit.</I>
Yet licensed physicians, particularly those who did not come from "big
name" medical schools, competed vigorously for lodge contracts, perhaps
because of the security they offered; and this competition continued to
keep costs low.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times,Times New Roman">The response of the medical establishment,
both in America and in Britain, was one of outrage; the institution of
lodge practice was denounced in harsh language and apocalyptic tones. Such
low fees, many doctors charged, were bankrupting the medical profession.
Moreover, many saw it as a blow to the dignity of the profession that trained
physicians should be eagerly bidding for the chance to serve as the hirelings
of lower-class tradesmen. It was particularly detestable that such uneducated
and socially inferior people should be permitted to set fees for the physicians'
services, or to sit in judgment on professionals to determine whether their
services had been satisfactory. The government, they demanded, must do
something.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times,Times New Roman">And so it did. In Britain, the state
put an end to the "evil" of lodge practice by bringing health care under
political control. Physicians' fees would now be determined by panels of
trained professionals (<I>i.e., </I>the physicians themselves) rather than
by ignorant patients. State-financed medical care edged out lodge practice;
those who were being forced to pay taxes for "free" health care whether
they wanted it or not had little incentive to pay extra for health care
through the fraternal societies, rather than using the government care
they had already paid for.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times,Times New Roman">In America, it took longer for the
nation's health care system to be socialized, so the medical establishment
had to achieve its ends more indirectly; but the essential result was the
same. Medical societies like the AMA imposed sanctions on doctors who dared
to sign lodge practice contracts. This might have been less effective if
such medical societies had not had access to government power; but in fact,
thanks to governmental grants of privilege, they controlled the medical
licensure procedure, thus ensuring that those in their disfavor would be
denied the right to practice medicine.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times,Times New Roman">Such licensure laws also offered
the medical establishment a less overt way of combating lodge practice.
It was during this period that the AMA made the requirements for medical
licensure far more strict than they had previously been. Their reason,
they claimed, was to raise the quality of medical care. But the result
was that the number of physicians fell, competition dwindled, and medical
fees rose; the vast pool of physicians bidding for lodge practice contracts
had been abolished. As with any market good, artifical restrictions on
supply created higher prices — a particular hardship for the working-class
members of fraternal societies.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times,Times New Roman">The final death blow to lodge practice
was struck by the fraternal societies themselves. The National Fraternal
Congress — attempting, like the AMA, to reap the benefits of cartelization
— lobbied for laws decreeing a legal minimum on the rates fraternal societies
could charge. Unfortunately for the lobbyists, the lobbying effort was
successful; the unintended consequence was that the minimum rates laws
made the services of fraternal societies no longer competitive. Thus the
National Fraternal Congress' lobbying efforts, rather than creating a formidable
mutual-aid cartel, simply destroyed the fraternal societies' market niche
— and with it the opportunity for low-cost health care for the working
poor.</FONT>
