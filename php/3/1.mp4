*Californians are turning to vending machines for safer water. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/02/california-water-vending-machines-quality">Are they being
swindled</a>?*

<p>
Whether or not any given brand of bottled water is a swindle in the
narrow sense, to give up on tap water and resort normally to bottled
water is being swindled in a broader sense.

*[US military] contractors gleefully report record earnings in divisions
that bid on 'classified' projects, <a href="https://boingboing.net/2019/11/29/your-tax-dollars-at-work.html">the fastest-growing part of the
Pentagon's budget</a>.*

<p>
Aside from the harm of a pit for public money spent in unaccountable
ways, there is also the danger that these systems will be used to
repress people, either in the US or elsewhere.  This includes mass
surveillance, which (<a href="https://stallman.org/archives/2018-jul-oct.html#20_August_2018_(Uighurs_outside_China)">as China shows, especially in Xinjiang</a>) is the preparatory step for repression.

<description><![CDATA[<p>
What to do with imprisoned Islamist terrorists <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/30/terrorists-prison-releases-mistakes-deaths">poses a conundrum,
world-wide</a>.

<p>
In Western countries the danger of Islamist terrorism is pretty small,
overall.  The danger of being murdered by an Islamist terrorist is
tiny compared with the danger of being murdered for some other reason,
and unless you are black that too is small.

<p>
Thus, if we resist the pressure to freak out about this tiny danger, we
will find that releasing Islamist convicts at the end of their
sentences is an acceptably small risk in an otherwise-risky world.

<p>
Corbyn <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/01/jeremy-corbyn-calls-for-focus-on-rehabilitation-of-terrorists-in-prison">is resisting that pressure</a>.

<p>
Setting up a system that is less corrupt will be a bigger challenge.
I hope they succeed.

<p>
Regarding Ayatollah Sistani, I have read that the long-established
Shi'a tradition is to have separation between the religion and state,
so that religious leaders can criticize oppression by the state.
Iran's "Islamic Republic" was an aberration against this tradition.

everyone else</a>.
<p>
Aside from the valid argument that programs which help everyone are
harder for plutocratists to eliminate, the point at hand will make
little difference in practice.  Rich people won't make use of gratis
public college education, because they will send their children to
private colleges.

I think he should go further.  For crimes that are not violent or
terribly serious, the warrants should be discarded after some years.

Scientists do not have enough knowledge to estimate how fast methane
is leaking out of the ground and sea bottom into the air, and can't
begin to predict <a href="https://mahb.stanford.edu/blog/the-methane-gun/">how much this will contribute to global heating in
the future</a>.

<p>
If it happens fast, it could push the ecosphere's temperature up by 7
degrees C.  This would be likely to kill most of humanity, perhaps
even all.

Ohio has already prohibited abortion (though this law has not been
approved by courts).  Now its Republican-gerrymandered legislature is
planning to define a fertilized egg as a human being.  <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/29/ohio-extreme-abortion-bill-reimplant-ectopic-pregnancy">This means women
would be imprisoned for failing to carry it to term</a>.

<p>
The law would also forbid doctors from treating an ectopic pregnancy
(by requiring them to do the impossible afterward).  Without treatment,
ectopic pregnancy carries a substantial chance of death.

Giuliani <a href="https://www.commondreams.org/news/2019/11/27/massive-criminal-enterprise-giuliani-reportedly-sought-ukraine-business-deals-he">pursued various personal business deals with Ukrainian
government agencies and officials</a>.

<p>
There is nothing inherently corrupt in offering Ukraine the service of
finding money that has been siphoned away from the Ukraine by corrupt
former officials.  That service, done honestly, could be well worth
the price Ukraine pays for it, if it leads to Ukraine's recovery of a
substantial fraction of that money.

<p>
However, for Giuliani to offer that service to Ukraine while serving
as the conman's lawyer while the conman shakes Ukraine down is a
corrupt combination &mdash; in effect, a secondary shakedown.

In general, I condemn paying ransom for hostages.  However, in this

for Iran to take people hostage to get that money back, but Britain

The EU national governments rejected a proposed directive to make
companies disclose how much sales they have in each country and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/28/12-eu-states-reject-move-to-expose-companies-tax-avoidance">how
much tax they pay to each country</a>.

<p>
This demonstrates the power that these companies have over the
governments that have become their servants, and the importance of
measures to cut off their poverty.

<p>
The plutocratic system is the root of most evils in the world today.
There are a few exceptions &mdash; the system may have no particular
interest in bigotry, except when that proves useful for right-wing
politicians to distract public attention from plutocracy.

Selling durable plastic bags in the UK has led to an increase in
plastic for bags, because customers

Evgeny Morozov: the idea of protecting privacy by "breaking up" big
tech companies is misguided: what matters is not the size of companies
that collect personal data, but 
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/28/big-tech-populist-stance-big-money-big-state">who
controls those systems</a>.
<p>
I partly agree, but I would say that what is important is what
personal data they collect, and whether it is feasible to stop them
from collecting anything about you.
<p>
Meanwhile, breaking up the companies would at least reduce their power
to block and ignore regulations.

The native life of the Farallon Islands can be protected from
introduced mice by 
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/28/truly-astounding-inside-the-farallon-islands-battle-against-a-plague-of-mice">eradicating
them</a>.
<p>
Mice are not endangered, so I think we should proceed with the
eradication.  It will take work to protect vulnerable species (though
gulls are not worth the trouble of saving), but this work will be
needed just once.  If we succeed in eradicating the mice from any of
the Farallon Islands, the native species there will be safe
indefinitely from mice; with any luck, the operation will never have
to be repeated.

<guid isPermaLink="false">9efeee5e13d8a641b99e24c590f85638</guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>
Micah Sample, a student at Indiana Wesleyan University, <a href="https://reason.com/2019/11/26/indiana-wesleyan-micah-sample-cultural-appropriation/">was harshly
punished for publishing a statement rejecting the idea that "cultural
appropriation" is something to be condemned</a>.

<p>
One of the comments pointed out that the article errs in describing
his statement as "trollish".  He stated his sincere views, not
a phony provocation.

<p>
I've stated <a href="https://stallman.org/archives/2018-jul-oct.html#17_August_2018_(Racial_censorship)">similar views</a> and I stand by them.  Culture exists for everyone to appropriate,
because that is how culture develops.  It is as harmful for an ethnic
group to own a cultural practice as it is for Disney to own one.

<p>
This is not to say that there is no such thing as an offensive
statement.  Obviously, a statement or gesture can mock or insult
people, and it is normal for the targets to take offense at this.
Harsh mockery and insults are unkind, and can get to the point of
being nasty.

<p>
However, the issue at hand is the claim that incorporating elements
from some other cultural group into your statement or gesture is not
merely unkind but a violation of their rights, and that this is
regardless of the intended meaning.

<p>
There is an inherent risk in borrowing or "appropriating" elements
from a culture you don't know well: that of displaying your ignorance
or looking like a fool.  (The same things can happen with other
microsubcultures in your own culture.)  Don't blame anyone else if you
make such a mistake.  But we should let people live those mistakes
down.

just barely, <a href="https://www.commondreams.org/news/2019/11/26/expert-says-senate-democrats-sweeping-online-privacy-bill-answers-public-demand">to limit collection of some data</a>.

<p>
But it has obvious loopholes.  It won't require companies to reveal
the conclusions they have deduced from the personal data they have
access to &mdash; because they argue that those are not "the client's
data."  It won't, as far as I can see, limit the targeted ads that are
the basis for surveillance capitalism.

<p>
And it won't even try to make it possible to buy something over the
internet anonymously.  <a href="https://taler.net">We have the technology for this</a>.

<p>
The most sensitive personal data about you are where you go during the
day, what you do there, who you talk with, and what what you and they
say.  It should be illegal to set up or operate a system <a href="https://gnu.org/philosophy/surveillance-vs-democracy.html">which systematically collects any of those data, except when authorized
by a court order targeted at specific people</a>.

<p>
I propose a law requiring stores to offer the service of bringing an
item to the store for you to buy later, in exchange for an ordering
fee paid in advance.

A new coalition against Amazon <a href="https://www.commondreams.org/news/2019/11/26/athena-vs-amazon-new-coalition-debuts-eve-holiday-shopping-season-call-out-companys">plans to criticize the company heavily
during the holiday selling season</a>, but apparently not call (as i do) for refusing to buy from Amazon.

<p>
This doesn't reference a web site for the coalition, only a Twitter
URL.  I would like to see a list of the injustices they criticize,
because I worry that the fundamental injustice Amazon does <em>to its
customers</em>, making them identify themselves, is missing.

Here's <a href="https://stallman.org/amazon.html">my list of the injustices of Amazon</a>.

*That the EU now frets about the extent of China’s investment in
critical infrastructure but fails to acknowledge that its own policies
partly created the vulnerability <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/26/europe-china-billions-strings-attached">is evidence of a divided and
profoundly inconsistent approach to China</a>.*

Plutocratists see Bloomberg as the opportunity to give plutocracy
a good name again <a href="https://www.commondreams.org/views/2019/11/26/bloomberg-scandals-dont-bother-billionaires-punditry-class-cheerleaders">and avoid fixing its biggest problems</a>.

<p>
*Bloomberg kicks off campaign with $31m ad buy &mdash; and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/26/billionaires-us-elections-2020-president">he, Steyer and
   Trump make up two-thirds of all ad spends</a>.*

<p>
What a shame it would be if a billionaire got the Democratic nomination.
