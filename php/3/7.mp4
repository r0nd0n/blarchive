<p>
In Western countries the danger of Islamist terrorism is pretty small,
overall. The danger of being murdered by an Islamist terrorist is
tiny compared with the danger of being murdered for some other reason,
and unless you are black that too is small.
<p>
Thus, if we resist the pressure to freak out about this tiny danger, we
will find that releasing Islamist convicts at the end of their
sentences is an acceptably small risk in an otherwise-risky world.

Use of euphemisms such as "passed away" reflects a powerful and

<p>
There is nothing inherently corrupt in offering Ukraine the service of
finding money that has been siphoned away from the Ukraine by corrupt
former officials. That service, done honestly, could be well worth
the price Ukraine pays for it, if it leads to Ukraine's recovery of a
substantial fraction of that money.
<p>
However, for Giuliani to offer that service to Ukraine while serving
as the conman's lawyer while the conman shakes Ukraine down is a
corrupt combination &mdash; in effect, a secondary shakedown.

I partly agree, but I would say that what is important is what

Mice are not endangered, so I think we should proceed with the

gulls are not worth the trouble of saving), but this work will be

the Farallon Islands, the native species there will be safe
indefinitely from mice; with any luck, the operation will never have

Bloomberg, as mayor of New York City, eliminated some public libraries
and reduced the collections of the rest. <a target="_top" href="http://citizensdefendinglibraries.blogspot.com/2019/03/defending-libraries-testimony-to-city.html">Now New York City is doing more
of the same</a>.
<p>
My favorite library branch, the Donnell Library Center, is where I
went to look for textbooks on many subjects. It was shut down in 2008
to sell the land to a hotel, and replaced 8 years later with a much
smaller library.

<p>
Micah Sample, a student at Indiana Wesleyan University, <a target="_top" href="https://reason.com/2019/11/26/indiana-wesleyan-micah-sample-cultural-appropriation/">was harshly
punished for publishing a statement rejecting the idea that "cultural
appropriation" is something to be condemned</a>.
<p>
One of the comments pointed out that the article errs in describing
his statement as "trollish". He stated his sincere views, not
a phony provocation.
<p>
I've stated <a target="_top" href="https://stallman.org/archives/2018-jul-oct.html#17_August_2018_(Racial_censorship)">similar views</a> and I stand by them. Culture exists for everyone to appropriate,
because that is how culture develops. It is as harmful for an ethnic
group to own a cultural practice as it is for Disney to own one.
<p>
This is not to say that there is no such thing as an offensive
statement. Obviously, a statement or gesture can mock or insult
people, and it is normal for the targets to take offense at this.
Harsh mockery and insults are unkind, and can get to the point of
being nasty.
<p>
However, the issue at hand is the claim that incorporating elements
from some other cultural group into your statement or gesture is not
merely unkind but a violation of their rights, and that this is
regardless of the intended meaning.
<p>
There is an inherent risk in borrowing or "appropriating" elements
from a culture you don't know well: that of displaying your ignorance
or looking like a fool. (The same things can happen with other
microsubcultures in your own culture.) Don't blame anyone else if you
make such a mistake. But we should let people live those mistakes
down.

<i>30 November 2019</i></p>
<p>
Senate Democrats have introduced a data privacy bill which begins, though
just barely, <a target="_top" href="https://www.commondreams.org/news/2019/11/26/expert-says-senate-democrats-sweeping-online-privacy-bill-answers-public-demand">to limit collection of some data</a>.
<p>
But it has obvious loopholes. It won't require companies to reveal
the conclusions they have deduced from the personal data they have
access to &mdash; because they argue that those are not "the client's
data." It won't, as far as I can see, limit the targeted ads that are
the basis for surveillance capitalism.
<p>
And it won't even try to make it possible to buy something over the
internet anonymously. <a target="_top" href="https://taler.net">We have the technology for this</a>.
<p>
The most sensitive personal data about you are where you go during the
day, what you do there, who you talk with, and what what you and they
say. It should be illegal to set up or operate a system <a target="_top" href="https://gnu.org/philosophy/surveillance-vs-democracy.html">which systematically collects any of those data, except when authorized
by a court order targeted at specific people</a>.
<p>
I propose a law requiring stores to offer the service of bringing an
item to the store for you to buy later, in exchange for an ordering
fee paid in advance.

<p>
A new coalition against Amazon <a target="_top" href="https://www.commondreams.org/news/2019/11/26/athena-vs-amazon-new-coalition-debuts-eve-holiday-shopping-season-call-out-companys">plans to criticize the company heavily
during the holiday selling season</a>, but apparently not call (as i do) for refusing to buy from Amazon.
<p>
This doesn't reference a web site for the coalition, only a Twitter
URL. I would like to see a list of the injustices they criticize,
because I worry that the fundamental injustice Amazon does <em>to its
customers</em>, making them identify themselves, is missing.
Here's <a target="_top" href="/amazon.html">my list of the injustices of Amazon</a>.
